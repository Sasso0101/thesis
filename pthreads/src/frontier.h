/**
 * @brief Thread-local vertex chunk pool for parallel graph traversal.
 *
 * The Frontier data structure manages per-thread pools of reusable vertex
 * chunks for use in parallel graph algorithms. Each thread maintains its own
 * chunk pool to minimize contention and improve cache locality.
 *
 * ## Design Overview
 * - The Frontier is composed of MAX_THREADS thread-local chunk pools.
 * - Each pool (`ChunkPool`) contains a dynamically resizable array of
 *   pointers to `VertexChunk` blocks.
 * - A `VertexChunk` holds a fixed-size array of vertices (CHUNK_SIZE) and acts
 *   as a LIFO (stack-style) buffer.
 * - Threads acquire and release chunks from their own pool in a lock-protected
 * manner.
 * - Chunks are not freed when released â€” they are reused, minimizing dynamic
 * allocations.
 *
 * ## Concurrency Model
 * - Chunk acquisition and release are thread-safe for individual threads (each
 * thread locks only its own pool).
 * - No synchronization is required for accessing the internal content of a
 * `VertexChunk` if it is used exclusively by one thread.
 * - Cross-thread stealing is supported via inspection functions.
